/**
 * The image manager class is a manager for images of any kind.
 * It makes sure there are no images loaded twice, but returns the appropriate
 * references to the already loaded image.
 *
 * The API is designed for lazy loading of images, so on map change events,
 * which renews most images, this manager tries not to reload the images
 * but rather keep them in memory.
