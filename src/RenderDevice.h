/** Provide abstract interface for FLARE engine rendering devices.
 *
 * Provide an abstract interface for renderning a Renderable to the screen.
 * Each rendering device implementation must fully implement the interface.
 * The idea is that the render() method replicates the behaviour of
 * SDL_BlitSurface() with different rendering backends, but bases on the
 * information carried in a Renderable struct.
 *
 * As this is for the FLARE engine, implementations use the the engine's global
 * settings context.
