        *  The size of the array is based on the node limit.
        *
        *  The nodes in this array are ordered based on their f value and the node with the lowest f value is always at position 0.
        *  The ordering is not linear, so after positon 0, we cannot assume that position 1 has the second shortest f value.
        *
        *  The ordering is based on a binary heap structure.
        *  Essentially, each node can have up to 2 child nodes and each child node must have a lower f value than its parent.
        *  This rule must be maintained whenever nodes are added or removed or their f value changes
        *
        *  The tree is represented by a 1 dimentional array where position 0 has children at position 1 and 2
        *  Node 1 would have children at position 3 and 4 and node 2 would have children at position 5 and 6 and so on
        *
        *  A more detailed explanation of the structure can be found at the below web address.
        *  Please note that there is additional code found in this class which is not mentioned in the article. This is to provide an index based on map position.
        *  Also note that the code within the article is based on arrays with starting position 1, whereas we use 0 based arrays.
