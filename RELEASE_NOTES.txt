* Finally, there is a new starting area called "Goblin Warrens" where you can fight low-level creatures to scavenge for beginner equipment.

* I now use Tiled 0.4.1 to edit map layers

OSARE v0.04 http://flarerpg.org/blog/20100414 "Font Support and Basic Menus"

Features:

* NOTE: now runs in windowed mode by default (apologies to XP users, windowed mode seems to change the desktop resolution). To run in fullscreen mode use -f or --fullscreen options at command line (easier to use options coming in a future release)
* FontEngine is a class that handles drawing of a bitmap font, with support for left/center/right justify (word wrap coming in a future release)
* Finished the icons for Powers. Commissioned Blarumyrran to finish the icons for the basic set of weapons/armors.
* Character Menu displays the proper info based on the Avatar's stats (level up coming in a future release)
* Powers Menu displays the Avatar's build (dragging powers to the action bar coming in a future release)
* Log and Inventory menus are mostly static. Inventory drag/drop and equipping coming later. I still haven't settled on a design for the Log, which will contain quest info and achievements.
* I refactored all the menus and hud under a MenuManager class. That class controls which menus should be displayed. In a future release it will handle drag/drop between the Inventory, Powers, and ActionBar menus.
* When the core menus are open (Character, Log, Powers, Inventory) the game action is paused.
* The actionbar hotkeys work but clicking on the action bar doesn't work yet. Also, still no way to change the default key bindings. All this coming in future releases.

ChangeLog:

* Combat to the death. You can kill zombies and they can kill you.

* Memory cleanup in the class deconstructors.

* Bug: fixed an issue in the Collider class with a variable not initialized
* Background music
* The hero and zombie can try to attack each other, I haven't yet implemented the attack collisions, damage, dying, etc.



OSARE v0.01 http://flarerpg.org/blog/20100101
