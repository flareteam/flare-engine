* Finally, there is a new starting area called "Goblin Warrens" where you can fight low-level creatures to scavenge for beginner equipment.

* FontEngine is a class that handles drawing of a bitmap font, with support for left/center/right justify (word wrap coming in a future release)
* Finished the icons for Powers. Commissioned Blarumyrran to finish the icons for the basic set of weapons/armors.
* Character Menu displays the proper info based on the Avatar's stats (level up coming in a future release)
* Powers Menu displays the Avatar's build (dragging powers to the action bar coming in a future release)
* Log and Inventory menus are mostly static. Inventory drag/drop and equipping coming later. I still haven't settled on a design for the Log, which will contain quest info and achievements.

* When the core menus are open (Character, Log, Powers, Inventory) the game action is paused.
* The actionbar hotkeys work but clicking on the action bar doesn't work yet. Also, still no way to change the default key bindings. All this coming in future releases.

ChangeLog:

* Combat to the death. You can kill zombies and they can kill you.
