This document tries to describe the style, we're using to code flare.
It's important to have a unique coding style within one project, because
it speeds up development as you become used to that style.

The coding style to be followed is basically the Qt coding style.
(http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_Coding_Style)

Exceptions to this style:
    * use tabs instead of spaces, and use a tabwidth of 4.

In case you're using QtCreator for hacking flare, import the
qt.xml file as found in this repository.
