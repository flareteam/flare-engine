# - Locate SDL2 library (modified from FindSDL2.cmake)
# This module defines
#  TENSORFLOW_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
#  SDL2_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
#  SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
#  SDL2_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL2
#
# This module responds to the the flag:
#  SDL2_BUILDING_LIBRARY
#    If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
#    only applications need main().
#    Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
#    module will attempt to locate and set the the proper link flags
#    as part of the returned SDL2_LIBRARY variable.
#
# Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP in your configuration
# and no SDL2_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL2 library
# (SDL2.dll, libsdl2.so, SDL2.framework, etc).
# Set SDL2_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL2 library, and configure again.
# Similarly, if you see an empty SDL2MAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this value
# as appropriate. These values are used to generate the final SDL2_LIBRARY
# variable, but when these values are unset, SDL2_LIBRARY does not get created.
#
#
# $SDLDIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR
# used in building SDL.
