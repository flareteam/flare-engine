To build for Android do next steps:

1. Install Java Development Kit (x86 version)
2. Install Google ADT (Android Development Tools) x86 http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adt.html
3. Install Android NDK x86 http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
4. Install SDK Platform for your Android version
5. Open Eclipse IDE
6. Use File > Import and select General > Existing Projects into Workspace.
7. Click next and then browse to the directory containing the project directory.

You will need to edit next settings

	1. In Eclipse IDE go to Project Properties: C/C++ General -> Paths and Symbols -> Includes -> GNU C++

	Change path to "platforms\android-16\arch-arm\usr\include"
	Change path to "sources\cxx-stl\stlport\stlport"

	2. In Eclipse IDE go to Project Properties: C/C++ Build. Change build command to your "ndk-build(.cmd)" path

8. Set-up SDL libraries

	1. Download SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf and extract them to \jni\ folder (so it will be like jni\SDL2\src\SDL.c)

	2. In SDL2_image/Android.mk, set SUPPORT_JPG and SUPPORT_WEBP to false.

	3. In SDL2_mixer/Android.mk, set SUPPORT_MOD_MIKMOD and SUPPORT_MP3_SMPEG to false.

NOTES:

1. Comments in data files should begin from ## (instead of # on desktop system). This is needed because Android ndk version of
std::getline() ignores first character, resolved from file. Because the same reason, data files should not begin from usefull data.
It should begin from comments(##). To workaround this issue, saved files sytax(mods.txt, stash.txt, savegame.txt, settings.txt)
was updated to begin with comments.

2. \data\insert_comment.sh is used to add ## comments to data files.
